# [University] - Introduction to Java course (again) #4

Another "introduction to java" course (it's, if I'm not miscounting) the 4th time since the second year (first year we
didn't program in OOP). Here is a list of small """project""" to taught us java. (At least we did learn how to make GUI
and us TCP & UDP...)

## Why this repo

Why this repo? Well, just like all the other university projects repos on my GitHub or over on
the [Stonks Life Inc. organization](https://github.com/Stonks-Life-Inc), I made this repo as a _souvenir_ of this
beautiful university years I've spent to this _marvelous and prestigious_ university.
